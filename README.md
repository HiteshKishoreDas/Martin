# Martin

Martin was my early (2015) try to write a program to answer questions. It would return its name if you wrote: "what" is your "name"?.
It basically ignored everything other than the interrogative word and the subject. Based on those two words, it did a search in a text file with pre-written answers and printed the answers.

I had written in TurboC++, hence some of functions don't work any more. I have tried to fix it but that broke the code. I have the original .exe file which still works and I have added that. Maybe someday I will go through the code and fix it. Old me didn't comment his codes..:P 

About the name "Martin", it stands for **M**r. **Art**ificial **In**telligence. I still use this name for my system. :)
